# ComfyUI-Flux-TryOff

This was inspired by [catvton-flux](https://github.com/nftblackmagic/catvton-flux). After heavy experimenting with Try-on, it's nice to have a [Try-Off](https://huggingface.co/xiaozaa/cat-tryoff-flux) model to work with.

The models should auto-download but you need:

- [xiaozaa/cat-tryoff-flux](https://huggingface.co/xiaozaa/cat-tryoff-flux)
- [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
