# ComfyUI-Flux-TryOff

Original Source: [catvton-flux](https://github.com/nftblackmagic/catvton-flux). I implemented their try-off inference code as ComfyUI nodes.

After heavy experimenting with Try-on, it's nice to have a [Try-Off](https://huggingface.co/xiaozaa/cat-tryoff-flux) model to work with.

The cat-try-off-flux model will download automatically.
If you don't have FLUX.1-dev in your comfyui checkpoints folder, download it there (requires license agreement).
